## Description

A website concept for a cider house using Angular 6. Features include user reviews, cider list, admin functionality, and jukebox for users to add songs to cider house playlist.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

### Installing

Complete the steps below to clone the project on to your personal machine and get the application running.

Clone the repo from github to your machine

```
git clone https://github.com/ryanjmurray/angular-team-week.git
```

This program is dependent that you already have node installed on your machine and node package manager. Afterwards run the install command.

```
npm install
```

You will then need to make sure you have a firebase account and a database available to store and retrieve information. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/ to sign up and create your database for your project. Create a file in the root of your app folder named api-keys.ts and paste in the information for adding firebase as a web app. Follow the pattern below for creating the file:

```
export const masterFirebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL_HERE",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET_HERES",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID_HERE"
}
```

To run the program run the command from the project file:

```
npm run start
```

Point your browser to localhost:4200
```
open http://localhost:4200/
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
